# S3 Gateway

S3 gateway is currently not deployed as a standalone component but is generated by the [EdgeCDN-X Controller](edgecdnx-controller-cache.md). Once an S3 origin is defined, the controller makes sure a new instance of the S3 gateway is placed in the same cluster where the caching is happening. To further improve the performance, we will eventually move this functionality into the [Ingress Nginx](ingress-nginx.md) itself.
